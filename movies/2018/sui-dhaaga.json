  "storyline": "Mauji (Varun Dhawan),an incompetently illiterate young man, has inconvenient work and individual life. His boss treats him like a dog, his father never stops cursing him, and he has not even touched his wife Mamta's (Anushka Sharma) hand despite being married for years due to lack of space at home. But he always carries himself with a big smile despite facing odds.
Although he appears to be a useless man, Mauji is a champion in the art of tailoring, which his father(Raghuvir Yadav) believes to be a disadvantageous mode of occupation. However, being fed-up of licking his boss' boots and getting motivation from Mamta, Mauji decides to self-employ himself and set off with his sewing machine. Although his parents are strictly against his decision, Mauji receives constant support from his wife, and in no time, the couple sees positive results.The couple faces a lot of hardships due to their innocence and family responsibilities. Mauji and Mamta fight back."
